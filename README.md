# Series-in-Java

This repository is focused on writing efficient algorithms to solve various series programs in Java. 

## Technologies Used
All you need is a Java IDE to write and run these programs. Online Java IDE's can also be used for this purpose. I prefer using Eclipse IDE.
For beginners, IDE refers to Integrated Development Environment. It is advisable to use Java installed on your computer than online sources.

## Description
### Fibonacci Series
There are several ways to find Fibonnaci series. Some of the algorithms used are:
<br>
1. Recurrsive Approach
2. Using Dynamic Programming
3. Optimised form of Dynamic Programming Concept
4. Using Fibonnaci Series Formula <br>
Time Complexity: O(1), Space Complexity: O(1)
<br>Formula for nth term in the fibonacci series.
  Fn = {[(√5 + 1)/2] ^ n} / √5
